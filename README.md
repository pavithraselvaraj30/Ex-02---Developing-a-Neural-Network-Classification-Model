# Ex-02---Developing-a-Neural-Network-Classification-Model


## AIM
To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## THEORY
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a neural network model that can classify a given iris flower into one of these three species based on the provided features.

Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
STEP 1:
Load the Iris dataset using a suitable library.

STEP 2:
Preprocess the data by handling missing values and normalizing features.

STEP 3:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

STEP 4:
Train a classification model using the training data.

STEP 5:
Evaluate the model on the test data and calculate accuracy.

STEP 6:
Display the test accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
